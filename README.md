Convert Strings to pig latin

## Assignment

Project assigment from Rust book chapter 8.

Convert strings to pig latin.

* The first consonant of each word is moved to the end of the word and “ay” is added, so “first” becomes “irst-fay.”
* Words that start with a vowel have “hay” added to the end instead (“apple” becomes “apple-hay”). Keep in mind the details about UTF-8 encoding!
